# Renegade BIBFRAME Documentation

## Who we are:

Anyone who is interested in BIBFRAME but finds the current avenues of discussion, development and/or implementation inadequate for whatever reason (or wants to join yet another BIBFRAME group).

We have diverse interests, skillsets, experiences, perspectives, but all think that linked data is a good avenue of exploration and experimentation for libraries, archives and museums. We want to not only discuss what BIBFRAME is, but create open and freely available documentation, training guides, framework recomendations, applications, etc. 

## Why:

We want to have BIBFRAME discussions that are constructive, open, and focus on shared work - whether it be the vocabulary itself, implementation documentation, interoperability with other linked data framworks, tools, applications etc.

Less on the navel-gazing, more on the experimentation. There is absolutely no shame in failed experiments here.

## Where:

We are using this GitHub repo primarily for shared documentation created out of discussions on Slack. Everyone is welcome to join in on the repo and/or the Slack site https://renegadebibframe.slack.com/ , as long as the follow the rules below. To get access, let Christina know by emailing cmharlow(at)gmail(dot)com or charlow2(at)utk(dot)edu.

## Rules to play by:

1. Don't be a jerk. Don't respond to a jerk by being a jerk. We will call out jerks.
2. Diversity is not just welcomed, it is needed. No sort of shaming here allowed at all (unless it is shame over the fact that your favorite animal is not a goat).
3. Assumption for this group is that Linked Data is worth serious experimentation and work. If you want to discuss why we should not use Linked Data (however that manifests itself in debates), we understand it is a valid topic, but this is not the place for that discussion.
4. Everyone is invited to join the discussion and work on Slack, and results from that discussion will be publicly-available via the GitHub repo, to which anyone can contribute.
5. Everything is up for change as the group wants. 

Lurkers are welcomed, and there are no stupid questions here (although follow Rule 3 on this).
