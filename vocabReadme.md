#BIBFRAME Vocabularies

BIBFRAME vocabulary development has splintered a bit, but there seems to be a core vocabulary that goes through the different permutations.

Goals for Renegade BIBFRAME:
  1. Review permutations
  2. Get any available vocabulary documentation/code linked to here for ease of review.
  3. Document what we deem to be core BIBFRAME, then proceed with making recommendations for change or usage. Discussion of how this is interoperable with other BIBFRAME versions  should happen here.
